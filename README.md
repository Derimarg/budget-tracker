## Description
  
This is an app that will allow to track withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection, so that an account balance is accurate when traveling, will follow the next conditions:

- Given a budget tracker without an internet connection when the user inputs an expense or deposit will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit.

- When the user reestablishes an internet connection, the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated.
